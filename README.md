🚀 Project Sentinel
AI-Powered Code Optimization & Testing Platform

Project Sentinel transforms ordinary code analysis into an intelligent, all-in-one AI development assistant that tests, optimizes, secures, and enhances entire codebases.

🧠 Overview

Originally designed to fix Sarah’s pain points around broken tests and refactoring, Project Sentinel has evolved into a full AI-powered code optimization platform that goes beyond test generation.

It now delivers multi-dimensional analysis across performance, security, quality, testing, and algorithms — all in real-time, with powerful visual insights.

🎯 What Problem We Solve

Modern developers face issues like:

❌ Missed edge cases

❌ Broken tests after refactoring

❌ Slow, inefficient code

❌ Hidden security vulnerabilities

❌ Poor visibility into code performance

Project Sentinel solves all of these at once.

🔥 Why Project Sentinel Stands Out

🌐 Multi-language support
JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++

⚡ Works offline
No dependency on external APIs — perfect for hackathons

🛡️ Full development lifecycle coverage
Testing → Performance → Security → Quality → Optimization

📊 Real, measurable metrics
Not just static analysis — actual runtime profiling

🎨 Beautiful UI
Professional dashboards designed for clarity & impact

🎥 Demo Scenarios (Hackathon Friendly)

Convert an O(n²) function to O(n) and show a 1000% speed boost

Detect security vulnerabilities + auto-fix suggestion

Generate complete test suites in seconds

Export a full analysis report
